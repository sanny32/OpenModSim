- Discrete Coils/Flags
```
    0x01 - Read Coils
    0x02 - Read Discrete Inputs
    0x05 - Write Single Coil
    0x0F - Write Multiple Coils
```

- Registers
```
    0x03 - Read Holding Registers
    0x04 - Read Input Registers

```
    
The following simulations are available:

- Discrete Coils/Flags
```
    Random - simulate flag randomly
    Toggle - simulate flag on/off periodicaly
```

- Registers
```
    Random - simulate register randomly
    Increment - simulate register from Low Limit to High Limit with a given Step
    Decrement - simulate register from High Limit to Low Limit with a given Step
```

# Scripting
  From version 1.2.0 Open ModSim supports scripting. Qt runtime implements the [ECMAScript Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) standard, so Javascript is used to write code.

  Scripts can be launched in two modes: Once or Periodically. If you run script in Once mode the script will stop after it finishes executing. In Periodically mode, the script will start after a certain period of time until the user stops it or the method is called
  ```javascript
  Script.stop();
  ```
Here is an example of using the script in the Periodically mode
```javascript
/**************************************************************************/
/*
/* Example script that store value after 3 seconds
/*
***************************************************************************/

function clear()
{
    /* Write to a Holding register at address 1 zero value */
    Server.writeHolding(1, 0);
}

/* init function */
function init()
{
    /* Set the server address base starts from one (1-based) */
    Server.addressBase = AddressBase.Base1;

    clear();
    
    /* Runs when Hodling register value at address 1 was changed */
    Server.onChange(Register.Holding, 1, (value)=>
    {
        if(value === 1)
        {
            /* Runs after 3 seconds and increase Holding register value at address 10 
             * Then stop script execution
             */
            Script.setTimeout(function()
            {
                Server.writeHolding(10, Server.readHolding(10) + 1);
                Script.stop();
            }, 3000);
        }
     });
}

/* Runs once when script started */
Script.onInit(init);
```
